<h2 id="what-engine-is-best-for-me">What engine is best for me?</h2>
<p>Choosing what game engine you are going to use for the creation of
your game is a crucial decision as going with the wrong engine can lead
to scrapping the whole project and restarting all over again.</p>
<p>And the answer is…….it depends.</p>
<h2 id="unreal-engine-4">Unreal Engine 4</h2>
<p><img src="../img/UnrealE4.png" /></p>
<p>Unreal Engine 4 was my first game engine in my game development
journey. From my experience, it can be a fairly heavy program, causing
my CPU or GPU usage to skyrocket to 100% when importing assets inside
the engine(but that could be just me since my pc isnt the best). Unreal
Engine is famously known for the super hyperrealistic graphics reaching
the point where they are indistinguishable from the real world and the
virtual world. The engine uses the C++ programming language which can be
intimidating to beginners or in general, as it tends to not be a not so
forgiving language as you’ll have to manually allocate a safe memory
space for your code. Despite being a hard language to learn, learning
C++ can be very rewarding as it can help learn other languages easier
and alot of Game studios use C++ as their main language. Unreal also
uses Blueprints, which is blocks of code connecting together also known
as optical programming, but my opinion is that it can be fairly limited
as you dont actually learn how to code, and it will only get you so far.
Unfortunately, one of the downsides of unreal is that there’s barely any
tutorials online and especially C++ tutorials, so you are going to have
to rely heavily on the documentation.</p>
<h2 id="unity-engine">Unity Engine</h2>
<p><img src="../img/unity.jpg" /></p>
<p>Arguably one of the most famous if not the most famous game engine is
the Unity Game Engine. Unity has a nice documentation but it also has a
ton of tutorials online making a far easier game engine to learn
compared to Unreal. As for the programming language, Unity can use java
but the main programming language is C#, which is a bit more
user-friendly compared to Unreal’s C++, as it handles things like
garbage collection and memory allocation in the background for you.
Unfortunately, because Unity is so famous, it has a bad reputation when
it comes to the quality of the games it produces, because alot of
beginners use the engine to make very crappy games in order to make some
quick money.</p>
