## For every project finished, there's at least 5 unfinished.

In this page, i want to share with you some of my projects that i either never got to finishing them or i just wanted to try and experiment with other genres!Of course they have no title...dont judge!

## 2D Platformer

![](../videos/2dPlatformer.mp4)

One of my favourite game series growing up was the Super mario series.I really enjoy this style of gameplay, so it was only a matter of time i started experimenting with 2D Platformers. The video is me, testing my character's and monster's movement and fighting mechanics. All the artwork i found on itchio from very talented artists:)


## 2D Plane game...thingy

![](../videos/2dPlane.mp4)

This game's idea was inspired by a game so old i dont even think i can find it on the internet anymore. I played around with the idea of wave spawining, which is basically the game spawining more enemies the longer you stay aive. The artwork was done by my then girlfriend which was very kind of her. Although some of my classmates enjoyed it, i never got to finish it.


##  Horror Test

![](../videos/horrorGameTest.mp4)

When it comes to making a game, i think making a horror game and the idea of making people scared is on top of a beginner's list. I had made a small horror level with Unreal before so i decided to try it out with Unity as well, which is a little bit unusual as i rarely play horror games because i tend to jump alot. i liked the cliche idea of you having the role of a detective who's gone out into the woods to investigate a forgotten case, only to be met with the paranormal. I found out some assets in Unity's store, as im nowhere near to the level of making my own 3d models, and i gave thema try to see how the movement and the overall feelling of the game is.
