## A little bit about me

Ever since i was a kid, i loved playing video games so much to the point where i used to spend at least 8 hours a day infront of the TV.Back then the thought of how a video game works, with all the complex characters and monsters, abilities, voice actors, beautiful story lines to name a few, seemed like black magic to me. So naturally i started having all those question about how could someone even attemp to approach such task, and soon begun to imagine of maybe creating my own world some day. During the summer before starting high school, i decided to start my journey with the Unreal Engine 4 since it was free and it looked cool, so i started experimenting with unreal's blueprint system. Soon though, i realised that in order to actually learn how to make games, i would have to learn an actual programming language nad Unreal's C++ was very intimidating for me back then, so i kinda gave up for a little bit. Starting highschool, i decided to give it a go again but this time i decided to switch to Unity game engine instead because there were more tutorials online and C# just clicked wth me. To cut a long story short, it was a difficult and frustrating but incredibly rewarding experience and if i could do it again from the start i would. Alot of years have passed since then and i gotta be honest, i was inactive for more than half of them due to burning out, so dont expect anything of a good quality! But with that being said, i would like to introduce to you my first ever video game!:)  


## Roll a ball

Unity has a few nice beginner tutorials and one of them is the Roll A Ball tutorial. It basically teaches you the very basics such as how to use the Unity Editor, how to have basic movement, how to pick up items and have a simple score system.i finished it quickly and i was instantly hooked, but the ending result was just not good enough for me so i decided to look around, experiment with the code and add a few more stuff to make the game feel more alive. I also started playing around with 3DS MAX and had learned the very very basics, so i made some simple 3d models for characters and made some super cool traps as well!


In order to win, you have to complete all of the 3 levels in the game, but each level gets progressivly harder. You win a level by collecting the amount of diamonds it needs to get to the next level. There are different coloured diamonds and each time you collect one, your speed increased by a bit depending on what color it is. On top of that, each level introduces new traps that you have to avoid! Oh, and the floor spins around aswell, causing your character to move out of your control!

## What did i learn?

Even though such task was very intimidating at first, the overall expe was very rewarding. I learned how to write and dissect code and to experiment with it on my own, and how to approach my ideas and problem solve them. I also learned how important feedback from other people is, and how important balancing your game can be because i accidentally made it too difficult even for me! But the most important thing i learned is to also have some fun while learning, because it is too easy to get overwhelmed and discouraged especially when dealing with something unfamiliar. Dont beat yourself up if you dont succeed in the first try, dont rush it, you got the rest of your life to figure it out.
